# Express.js Application Components

This repository contains various components for building an Express.js application, including middleware, routes, and cache operations.

## 1. Logger Middleware

### File: `logger.js`

This module configures a logger using Winston, a versatile logging library. It sets up logging levels, formats, and transports to files and the console.

## 2. Error Handling Middleware

### File: `errorhandler.js`

The error handling middleware logs errors using the configured logger and sends an error response to the client.

## 3. JWT Token Verification Middleware

### File: `verifyuser.js`

This middleware verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provided in the request headers. It decodes and validates the token, allowing access to protected routes.

## 4. Cache Operations

### Files: `cache/redisconnection.js`, `cache/operations.js`

These modules handle caching using Redis. The `redisconnection.js` sets up a Redis client, and `operations.js` provides functions to set and get data from the Redis cache.

## 5. Express Application and Routes

### File: `index.js`

This file sets up an Express application, defines routes for objectives and users, and connects to MongoDB. It uses the logger and error handling middleware.

### Files: `Route/objectiveroute.js`, `Route/objectiveuser.js`

These files define the routes and handlers for objectives and users, respectively, using Express.js.

## 6. MongoDB Models

### Files: `model/objectives.js`, `model/auth.js`

These files define Mongoose models for objectives and user authentication, representing the structure of documents in MongoDB.

## Usage

To use these components in an Express.js application:

1. Include the required components in your project.
2. Configure them as needed (e.g., set up database connections, logger configurations).
3. Integrate them into your Express.js application using `app.use()` for middleware or `app.use()` for routes.

For detailed usage, refer to the respective files and their descriptions.
